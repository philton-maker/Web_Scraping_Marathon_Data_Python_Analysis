    "Python's `while` loops can be very useful in web scraping.\n",

    "The `condition` can really be anything you want it to be.\n",
    "Generally, you will continue until an element can't be found.\n",

    "Essentially: `while` element `x` exists, scrape the website and then move to the next.\n",
    "Once element `x` ceases to exist, exit out of the loop!\n",

    "To help practice this concept, we can use this function `generate_sequence` to simulate elements existing on a website!\n",
